# NotebookLM Prompts: Nereus Visualization & Pitch

## 1. Visual Representations (Infographics)

**Objective:** Generate a concise, high-impact 3-part graphic series showing:
1.  **The Invisible Problem:** The disconnect between marine science and finance.
2.  **The Hybrid Solution:** The "Physical Link" (Bridge Axiom) connecting the two.
3.  **The Verified Impact:** Capital flowing to restored ecosystems.

**Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> "Create a 3-part infographic concept for 'Nereus: The Bridge to Blue Capital'.
>
> **Part 1: The Gap.** Show a divide between a vibrant coral reef (left) and a sterile bank vault (right). Label the gap 'Trust Void: $175B'.
> **Part 2: The Physical Link.** Show a glowing neon 'Bridge Axiom' node connecting the reef to the vault. Label the node 'BA-004: 97% Wave Reduction'. Show data flowing through it like a circuit.
> **Part 3: The Flow.** Show the vault opening, with gold coins flowing into the reef, causing it to bloom. Label the result 'Verified Natural Capital'.
>
> **Style:** Minimalist, futuristic, high-contrast (deep ocean blue & gold).
> **Text:** Keep text minimal (under 5 words per label). Focus on visual flow and connection."

## 2. Investor Pitch Deck (Summary Slides)

**Objective:** Create a compelling 5-slide narrative for sovereign wealth funds and impact investors.

**Prompt for NotebookLM:**
> "Draft a 5-slide pitch deck outline for 'Nereus: Hybrid Intelligence for the Blue Economy'.
>
> **Slide 1: The Hook.** 'The Ocean is an Asset Class.' (Problem: Invisible Value).
> **Slide 2: The Logic.** 'We Don't Guess. We Prove.' (Solution: The Hybrid Intelligence Model - MARIS + Semantica). Explain the 'Physical Link' concept simply.
> **Slide 3: The Engine.** 'Powered by 40 Global Axioms.' (Technology: Show the diversity of the 40 Bridge Axioms driving the v6 Scenario Intelligence engine - Carbon Market Revenues, SSP Climate Impacts, Tourism Pricing).
> **Slide 4: The Scale.** 'From One Reef to the World.' ( Traction: $1.62B Portfolio across 9 Global Sites - Cabo Pulmo to Galapagos. Address the scale by highlighting the automated live data pipeline connecting directly to global ecological databases like OBIS, WoRMS, and Marine Regions to characterize any MPA on Earth).
> **Slide 5: The Ask.** 'Invest in Truth.' (Call to Action: Join the v6 Global Scaling Platform).
>
> **Tone:** Confident, scientific, visionary. Use short, punchy bullet points. Focus on 'Verification' and 'Provenance' as the key differentiators."
