## 1. The Global Problem: The Invisible Value of the Ocean

### The Financial Gap
A **$175 billion annual funding gap** exists for ocean conservation (SDG 14). While terrestrial carbon markets have matured, "Blue Carbon" and marine biodiversity markets remain stagnant.

### The Trust Crisis
Investors (banks, insurers, sovereigns) cannot deploy capital because they lack **trust**. Current data is:
1.  **Fragmented:** Locked in PDFs, disparate databases (WoRMS, OBIS), and academic silos.
2.  **Opaque:** "Black box" AI models give answers without proving *how* they reached them.
3.  **Disconnected:** Financial value is rarely physically linked to the underlying ecological health.

**The Result:** Capital sits on the sidelines while critical ecosystems (coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass) degrade. We cannot value what we cannot verify.

## 2. The Nereus Solution: "Hybrid Intelligence"

Nereus is not just another data platform. It is a **Hybrid Intelligence System** that fuses two distinct powers:
1.  **MARIS (The Engine):** A high-performance deterministic query and forward-looking **Scenario Intelligence** engine.
2.  **Semantica (The Brain):** A rigorous ontological framework that extracts logic from science.

### The Core Philosophy: "The Logic is Physically Linked"
Unlike traditional AI (RAG) that hallucinates answers from statistical patterns, Nereus "thinks" by traversing **Bridge Axioms**—deterministically extracted rules physically stored in a knowledge graph.

**The Formula:**
`[Ecological Data]  ->  [Bridge Axiom Node]  ->  [Financial Value]`

*   **Ecological Data (Layer 1):** Biomass, species richness, habitat extent.
*   **Bridge Axiom (Layer 2):** "Reefs reduce wave energy by 97% (Beck 2018)."
*   **Financial Value (Layer 3):** Avoided flood damages ($272B/yr), insurance premium reduction.

Every financial number produced by Nereus is a **logical proof** that traces back to a specific line in a peer-reviewed paper.

## 3. System Architecture: The "Intelligence Factory"

### Phase 1: The Build (Agentic Extraction)
Before the system runs, an army of AI agents builds the knowledge foundation:
1.  **Discovery:** Agents scour 195+ T1/T2 peer-reviewed papers.
2.  **Extraction:** Agents extract **Entities** (Species, Habitats) and **Bridge Axioms**.
3.  **Ingestion:** This "Intelligence Payload" is loaded into a Neo4j Graph Database.

### Phase 2: The Runtime (Deterministic Reasoning)
When an investor asks, *"What is the value of Cabo Pulmo?"*:
1.  **No Hallucination:** The system does *not* guess.
2.  **Graph Traversal:** It walks the graph: `Cabo Pulmo -> Coral Reef -> [Axiom: Flood Protection] -> $29.7M`.
3.  **Provenance:** It returns the value *plus* the exact citation chain (DOI) that justifies it.

## 4. The "Intelligence Payload": 40 Bridge Axioms

Nereus is powered by a dynamic registry of **40 validated Bridge Axioms** (BA-001 to BA-040). These are not just text; they are executable code that power real-time valuations and forward-looking scenarios.

**Examples:**
*   **BA-004 (Coastal Defense):** *IF habitat=CoralReef AND status=Healthy THEN wave_attenuation=0.97 AND value=flood_protection.*
*   **BA-002 (Biomass Uplift):** *IF MPA=No-Take AND Age>10yrs THEN biomass=670%_of_unprotected.*
*   **BA-013 (Blue Carbon):** *IF habitat=Seagrass THEN sequestration_rate=0.84 tCO2/ha/yr.*

## 5. Deployment: The v6 Global Scaling Platform

The current production system has grown into a powerful v6 engine, managing a **$1.62 Billion Natural Capital Portfolio** across 9 global sites:

1.  **Cabo Pulmo (Mexico):** AAA-rated coral reef recovery engine. ($29M ESV)
2.  **Shark Bay (Australia):** World's largest seagrass carbon sink. ($21.5M ESV)
3.  **Galapagos (Ecuador):** Diverse volcanic/pelagic biodiversity hotspot. ($320M ESV)
4.  **Great Barrier Reef / Ningaloo (Australia):** Massive scale coral resilience. ($83M/$292M)
5.  **And more:** Belize, Raja Ampat, Sundarbans, Aldabra, Cispata Bay.

**Features:**
*   **Live Data Integration:** Automated characterization pipeline connecting directly to global ecological databases (OBIS, WoRMS, Marine Regions) to assess any MPA globally.
*   **Forward-Looking Scenario Intelligence:** Deterministically predict climate impacts (SSP2-4.5) and model blue carbon market revenues.
*   **Live GraphRAG:** Chat with historical site data, guided by valid logic.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulator:** Stress-test valuations (P5, P50, P95) based on axiom uncertainty.
*   **TNFD Compliance:** Auto-generate biodiversity disclosure reports (LEAP approach).
*   **Provenance Graph:** Visual proof of every claim linking biology to finance.

## 6. Applications & Impact

*   **For Sovereigns:** Issue high-integrity Blue Bonds backed by verified natural capital.
*   **For Insurers:** Accurately price coastal resilience risk based on reef health.
*   **For Banks:** Screen portfolios for nature-related risks (TNFD compliance).
*   **For Science:** Rapidly synthesize global literature into actionable regional models.

Nereus bridges the gap between **Science** (what is true) and **Finance** (what is valuable), unlocking the capital needed to save our oceans.
