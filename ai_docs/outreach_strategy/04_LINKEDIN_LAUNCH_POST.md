## 📢 Publication Intro Post

*(Use this text to accompany the video or link to the long-form article below)*

In my previous post, we explored how semantic graphs like Rizon help us map the *present* state of natural capital, moving beyond the limits of raw satellite pixels. But describing the present is only the first step. 

The barrier to financing nature is no longer just a lack of data. The barrier is translation. We have incredible planetary models, but ecological data doesn't easily translate into risk envelopes or institutional reporting standards like TNFD. We cannot finance what we cannot confidently underwrite.

Today, after deep collaboration with Mohd Kaif and the Semantica team, we are sharing an early look at **Nereus**: an infrastructure layer designed to bridge this exact gap. 

Nereus does not use open-ended AI to guess at ecological value. Instead, it relies on a "Bridge Axiom Engine": traversing a mathematically validated, DOI-backed knowledge graph from an ecological state directly into a financial Value at Risk (VaR). 

In the demo below, you will see it quantify **$1.62B in natural capital value** across a 9-site marine portfolio, run SSP climate scenarios, and instantly generate structured TNFD disclosures.

We are building this openly. It is currently marine-only, and we are working hard to increase our strict DOI-coverage. But the engine rests on a crucial premise for financial instruments: it is designed to "fail closed." If the evidence is insufficient, it flags the gap rather than providing an overconfident estimation.

This is early-stage infrastructure for deterministic natural capital intelligence. I invite you to read the full breakdown and join us on this journey. 👇

## 🌊 Beyond the Pixel: The Challenge of Comprehending Natural Capital

In my last post, I discussed a shared challenge at the intersection of Earth Observation and Nature-Based Solutions (NbS): while planetary-scale models provide crucial insights, they often struggle to capture the complex, systemic realities on the ground.

A satellite can measure the green reflectance of a 500-hectare mangrove coastal estate. But a pixel doesn't easily translate into legal tenure, overlapping community claims, or the cascading ecological shifts that follow a 10% drop in local fish biomass.

We previously explored this in the Colombian Pacific with **HiGEBCA**, binding 47 ecological and governance attributes to 1,601 mangrove polygons. It revealed that a significant portion of the theoretical carbon potential requires deep contextual integration to be realized in practice. 

We then took that data and transformed it into a living, interrogable semantic graph over 5,000 nodes strong, known as **Rizon**. Rizon showed us the *present* state of natural capital through spatial intelligence.

But an ontology that only describes the present is incomplete. The true frontier is predictive financial translation.

## ⚡ The $1.3 Trillion Context Gap

The world is facing a **$1.3 trillion annual financing gap** for nature. Capital remains sidelined partly because it's exceedingly difficult to underwrite complex ecological risks using static documents or models that aren't purpose-built for financial logic. 

Knowing the ecological state of an asset is a crucial first step, but pricing its financial risk and opportunity requires a different kind of precision.

## 🚀 Introducing Nereus: The Deterministic Translation Engine

We are now ready to unveil the next phase of this architecture: **Nereus**.

Developed in collaboration with Mohd Kaif (Lead Dev of Semantica), Nereus is a **Hybrid Intelligence System** designed to move beyond descriptive graphs into deterministic financial scenarios. 

If Rizon tells us the current state of a mangrove forest, Nereus answers the counterfactual: *What is the specific financial Value at Risk (VaR) if that forest degrades under an IPCC SSP2-4.5 climate scenario?*

We achieve this through two specialized engines:

**1. Semantica (The Provenance Engine)**
(https://github.com/Hawksight-AI/semantica)
An advanced NLP framework that ingests scientific literature, extracting causal claims and linking every data point back to a peer-reviewed DOI. This ensures clear transparency, answering "Says who?" for every pixel.

**2. MARIS (The Financial Logic & Scenario Layer)**
The predictive core. MARIS operationalizes the science using **"Bridge Axioms"**: deterministic, programmable contracts extracted directly from peer-reviewed literature.
*   **The Bridge Axiom:** *"IF habitat=CoralReef AND status=Healthy THEN wave_attenuation=0.97 AND value=flood_protection."*

Instead of an open-ended AI estimation, the agent traverses a verifiable graph path. For instance, from a sensor detecting a drop in biomass, through a mathematically validated axiom, to a calculated penalty on tourism revenue. It yields a defined financial exposure metric complete with probabilistic uncertainty envelopes (P5/P50/P95). **A clear, auditable trail from science to finance.**

### 🧠 Grounding the Future (Context-Aware GraphRAG)

In the screencast below, watch what happens when we ask the system a question.

*   Spin the **Global 3D Map** to the **Galapagos**, ask *"What are the risks?"*, and it extracts historical, DOI-backed intelligence about El Niño.
*   Switch to **Prospective Scenarios**, ask *"What happens to Belize under SSP2-4.5 by 2050?"*, and the deterministic engine projects a 23.4% ecosystem service value decline due to accelerating coral bleaching.
*   Click into **TNFD Compliance**, and the system instantly auto-generates a structured LEAP disclosure package, translating the ecological graph into established institutional reporting standards.

It is not just retrieving facts. It is grounding them in a current decision environment, projecting them into the future, and translating them for regulators.

### 🏗️ Early-Stage Infrastructure, Built Openly

Nereus is currently quantifying **$1.62 Billion in natural capital value** across a 9-site pilot marine portfolio. The engine runs on **40 curated Bridge Axioms**, translating peer-reviewed science directly into financial value.

But true institutional infrastructure is defined by its honesty regarding limitations. 

We are building this openly, which means acknowledging where we need to grow. Currently, the system is marine-only. Our evidence base tracks at 46.9% strict DOI coverage: a gap we are actively closing, and one our dashboard tracks transparently. Furthermore, our AI is built to "fail closed": if evidence is missing, confidence drops, and the system flags insufficient data. In the context of regulated financial instruments, we believe acknowledging uncertainty is safer and more useful than providing an overconfident estimation.

We are working to prove that it is possible to link the deep **Ecological Complexity** of our oceans to the **Financial Rigor** of an investment product through a transparent, mathematical chain of evidence. 

This is early-stage infrastructure for what we hope will become a new asset class. Welcome to the journey toward **Deterministic Natural Capital Intelligence**.
