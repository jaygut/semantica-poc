# MARIS | SEMANTICA - Investor Demo Dashboard

## Overview

Interactive Streamlit dashboard for the **Cabo Pulmo Investment Case**, designed for investor-facing demonstrations of the MARIS/Semantica provenance-first blue finance infrastructure. Dark-mode, single-scroll layout with professional financial styling.

The dashboard is powered by a static **Investment Grade Bundle** (`cabo_pulmo_investment_grade_bundle.json`) - a pre-computed, verified JSON artifact generated by the analysis notebook. This is a deliberate architectural choice: in high-stakes investor contexts, zero latency and 100% uptime are non-negotiable.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd investor_demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

**Data source:** If the bundle doesn't exist, run the notebook at `demos/context_graph_demo/cabo_pulmo_investment_grade.ipynb` to generate it.

## Dashboard Architecture

### Single-Scroll Page Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Masthead** | MARIS/SEMANTICA branding, site name, IFC Blue Finance and TNFD LEAP badges |
| **Investment Thesis** | Three-paragraph block: MARIS definition, Semantica provenance framework, context graphs concept |
| **Key Metrics** | 4 KPI cards: Annual ESV, Biomass Recovery, NEOLI Score, Climate Buffer |
| **Provenance Chain** | Fixed-position causal graph with 5 layers: Site, Ecological State, Ecosystem Services, Financial Value, Risk |
| **Bridge Axiom Evidence** | Table mapping 4 axioms (BA-001, BA-002, BA-011, BA-012) to plain-English meanings and DOI citations |
| **Valuation Composition** | Horizontal bar chart of service breakdown + CI context |
| **Risk Profile** | Monte Carlo distribution (10,000 simulations) + resilience/degradation risk cards |
| **Comparison Sites** | Papahanaumokuakea (5/5), Cabo Pulmo (4/5), Mesoamerican Reef (1-2/5) |
| **Framework Alignment** | IFC Blue Finance eligible uses + TNFD LEAP four-phase summary |
| **Caveats** | All 7 caveats from the data bundle |

### Sidebar

- Asset information (site name, area, designation year)
- NEOLI alignment breakdown with visual indicators
- Confidence level slider: Conservative (P5) / Base Case (Median) / Optimistic (P95)
- Methodology note and metadata

### Design Principles

- **Dark mode**: Navy/slate palette (`#0B1120` background, `#162039` card gradient)
- **No tabs**: Single-scroll page keeps the narrative flowing
- **No emojis**: Professional, sober financial tone
- **Provenance-first**: Every number traces to a DOI-backed source
- **Market-price methodology**: Actual expenditure data, not willingness-to-pay
- **Custom HTML/CSS**: All cards, KPIs, and tables use injected HTML for full visual control

## Strategic Architecture: "The Artifact is the Asset"

The dashboard deliberately uses a **static JSON bundle** rather than a live database connection:

1. **Reliability**: No database connectivity issues, timeouts, or demo glitches
2. **The bundle IS the product**: We're demonstrating that MARIS outputs are portable, immutable, and auditable - the kind of artifact that can be handed to auditors, insurers, or bond issuers
3. **Separation of concerns**: Compute layer (Semantica/graph DB) is decoupled from the presentation layer

## Key Demo Points

- **Confidence Slider**: Show how the valuation shifts across Conservative/Base/Optimistic scenarios - demonstrates probabilistic thinking, not point estimates
- **Provenance Chain**: The centerpiece - every financial claim traces through documented bridge axioms back to peer-reviewed ecological data
- **Bridge Axiom Evidence Table**: Click any DOI link to verify the source - this is the audit trail that makes MARIS different from generic ESG tools
- **Monte Carlo Distribution**: 10,000 simulations with P5/P50/P95 percentile markers - aligns with institutional risk management practices
- **Comparison Sites**: Demonstrates that NEOLI score predicts outcomes across sites

## Dependencies

- streamlit >= 1.31.0
- pandas >= 2.0.0
- plotly >= 5.18.0
- networkx >= 3.1
- numpy >= 1.24.0

## Terminology

- "NEOLI alignment" not "compliance" (we don't claim certification)
- "market-price" not "NOAA-adjusted" for Cabo Pulmo tourism
- ESV = $29.3M, Tourism = $25.0M, Biomass = 4.63x
