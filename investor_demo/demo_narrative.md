# Investor Demo Narrative: Nereus

## The Translation Layer for Ocean Finance

*10-minute pitch for conservation finance investors, blue bond issuers, and impact funds*

---

## Opening Hook (1 minute)

**"The ocean has a trust problem."**

Every year, billions of dollars in potential conservation finance sits on the sidelines because investors can't answer one simple question:

*"How do I know this marine conservation project will actually deliver ecological and financial returns?"*

The data exists - scattered across thousands of scientific papers, databases, and monitoring programs. But it's fragmented, incompatible, and often incomprehensible to financial decision-makers.

**We've built the bridge.**

## The Problem (2 minutes)

### The $175 Billion Gap

The UN estimates we need $175 billion per year by 2030 to protect 30% of the ocean. Current blue finance flows? About $5 billion.

Why the gap?

1. **Greenwashing fears**: Investors burned by terrestrial carbon scandals are skeptical of marine claims
2. **No standardized metrics**: Every project uses different measures of success
3. **Audit trail gap**: Claims can't be independently verified back to source data
4. **Complexity barrier**: Ecology is messy; finance wants clean numbers

### What Investors Actually Need

When a pension fund considers a $50 million blue bond, they need to know:
- Will the ecological outcomes materialize?
- How do those outcomes translate to financial returns?
- Can the claims be audited?
- What's the risk profile?

Current tools can't answer these questions with confidence.

## The Solution: Nereus (3 minutes)

### The Translation Layer

We've built an AI-powered knowledge graph that creates **audit-grade connections** between:

```
Ecological Data → Ecosystem Services → Financial Metrics
```

**Nereus** is the platform - powered by two engines:

**Semantica** (LLM-powered ontology system) extracts entities and relationships from scientific literature with 91% accuracy.

**MARIS** (Marine Asset Risk Intelligence System) translates those ecological facts into investment-grade metrics.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Knowledge Extraction**
- We've curated 195 peer-reviewed papers across coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass, and mangroves
- Semantica extracts quantitative relationships: "10% biomass increase → 3.46% tourism premium"
- Every fact linked to source with SHA-256 checksums

**Step 2: Bridge Axioms**
- We've identified 16 core "translation rules" that connect ecology to finance
- Example: Beck et al. 2018 shows coral reefs prevent $272 billion in annual flood damages
- Example: Hopf et al. 2024 shows no-take MPAs achieve biomass 670% of unprotected levels (6.70x ratio)

**Step 3: GraphRAG Queries**
- Ask natural language questions
- Get structured answers with confidence intervals
- Full provenance chain for every claim

### Demo: Cabo Pulmo Query

*[Live demo of knowledge graph query]*

**Query**: "What ecosystem services does Cabo Pulmo National Park provide, and what drove its recovery?"

**Answer** (generated by system):
> Cabo Pulmo achieved a 463% fish biomass increase over 10 years (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2011). The site met 4 of 5 NEOLI criteria (Edgar et al. 2014): no-take, enforced, old, and isolated. Current ecosystem service value: ~$29 million/year including tourism ($25M), fisheries spillover ($3.2M), carbon sequestration ($180K), and coastal protection ($890K). This represents a transformation from a degraded reef to what Nereus rates as an "AAA" reference condition.

**Key differentiator**: Every number in that answer links to a specific paper, page, and quote.

## Market Opportunity (2 minutes)

### Who Needs This?

1. **Blue Bond Issuers** ($5.6B market, growing 40%/year)
   - Need credible KPIs for use-of-proceeds verification
   - Our system generates habitat-specific metric recommendations

2. **Carbon Credit Projects** ($2B marine carbon market by 2030)
   - Need accurate baseline and sequestration estimates
   - Our axioms provide peer-reviewed coefficients for mangrove, seagrass, kelp

3. **Impact Investors** ($1.2T AUM in sustainability-focused funds)
   - Need to differentiate real impact from greenwashing
   - Our audit trail provides defensible claims

4. **TNFD Reporters** (1,200+ companies committed)
   - Need nature-related disclosure metrics
   - Our system maps ecological data to TNFD framework

### Revenue Model

   - PROV-O ontology for audit trails
   - Evidence tier classification (T1-T4)

3. **Domain-Specific**: Not a generic ESG tool
   - 195 curated marine papers (92% peer-reviewed)
   - Species linked to WoRMS, FishBase, GBIF identifiers
   - Bridge axioms calibrated to marine ecosystems

4. **Calibrated to Reality**: Cabo Pulmo as reference condition
   - System validated against best-documented marine recovery
   - Predictions match observed outcomes

## The Ask (1 minute)

### What We're Looking For

**Strategic Partners**
- Blue bond issuers who want to pilot the KPI recommendation system
- Conservation organizations with monitoring data to integrate
- Development finance institutions (IFC, ADB, IADB)

**Pilot Projects**
- 2-3 sites where we can demonstrate full workflow
- Baseline assessment → Monitoring integration → Financial structuring

**Investment**
- Seed round to scale engineering team
- Target: System handling 50+ concurrent site assessments

### The Vision

In 5 years, no blue bond gets issued without a Nereus rating. No marine carbon credit gets verified without our provenance chain. No TNFD disclosure happens without our ecological-financial translation.

**The ocean's trust problem? Solved.**
