Validation tests against Cabo Pulmo case study

TIMELINE: Week 6-7 (Phase 4: Bridge Axioms) and Week 13-14 (Phase 6: Testing)
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY: Critical - Validate predictions within ±20% tolerance
MILESTONE: All Cabo Pulmo validations passing

Test cases to implement:
- Test Cabo Pulmo data loading from case study JSON
- Test BA-001 application (biomass-tourism elasticity)
- Test BA-002 application (NEOLI score → biomass ratio)
- Test ecosystem service value calculations
- Test predictions within ±20% tolerance of observed values
- Test NEOLI score calculation (4/5 criteria)
- Test biomass recovery prediction (463% observed)
- Test tourism revenue prediction
- Test fisheries spillover value calculation
- Test full Cabo Pulmo query with provenance
- Test all bridge axioms applicable to Cabo Pulmo
- Test validation report generation
- Test confidence interval calculations
