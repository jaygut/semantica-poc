Unit tests for bridge axiom engine

TIMELINE: Week 6-7 (Phase 4: Bridge Axioms) - Develop alongside bridge_axiom_engine.py
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY: High - Validate axiom applications against Cabo Pulmo

Test cases to implement:
- Test bridge axiom loading from templates
- Test axiom pattern matching
- Test context matching (habitat applicability)
- Test coefficient calculations for each axiom
- Test uncertainty propagation through axiom chains
- Test axiom chaining (multi-hop reasoning)
- Test axiom application error handling
- Test axiom validation against Cabo Pulmo (±20% tolerance)
- Test NEOLI score calculation (BA-002)
- Test biomass-tourism elasticity (BA-001)
- Test otter-kelp-carbon cascade (BA-003)
- Test all 12 bridge axioms individually
- Test axiom application with invalid contexts
- Test confidence score calculation
